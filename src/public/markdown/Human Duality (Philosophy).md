## The Plausibility of Duality

When the self engages in self-deprecating, self-sabotaging or self-destructive behavior, the values and attributes held by the self are forced to be reconciled with the validity and causality of the pernicious actions against the biological fitness of the entity.

Biological fitness manifests in actions of self-preservation, self-propagation, and self-growth. 

When a destructive act is committed, the analytical self must reconcile why such an act was allowed by the agent himself.

This leads to the plausibility of duality — a separation between mind and body, the long-term and short-term self, the planner and the worker. The light and the dark. 

The plausibility of duality is merely a tool of man to cope with the burden of intelligence. It is a useful construct for the human consciousness. We need a model for why the self has allowed the self to self-destruct. We seek to understand questions like "Why did I let myself go too far?" 

We use this plausibility of duality to reason that there could be an "evil" side of you that allowed the self to destruct. The duality model enables an allocation of blame, perhaps onto your other half or your bad side. There may have been a little voice in your head that said, "C'mon, it’s not that bad."

Notice, "your." Who is you? One? Two?

After it’s all said and done, when the self is reflecting on its past, it articulates clearly a feeling of regret for the self-destructive behavior. Such a heinous crime committed by oneself to oneself must have its perpetrator indicted. Who should be indicted? One? Two?

One cannot easily indict oneself as a whole. The self understands it is, at least in part, and innately, a self-preservation engine - is that who should be indicted? To reconcile, a duality must be constructed to provide relief. 

The self is of two.

And now an indictment can be served! The self can invent the idea that it has two intermingled components and allocate blame on the part of the self that deserves an indictment - the scapegoat - to preserve its remaining agency. So, the biased self lives on - not as an observer, or a unified force, but a corrupted sentinel.

Unfortunately, this blame allocation model can quickly become unsustainable - as the mounting weight of pernicious actions followed by allocated blame grows to overpower the biased self. 

That is why we seek to absolve our sins. (thank you Jesus)

On the contrary, when the self commits an act of self-preservation or buttressing, there is no difficult reconciliation to make. There is no indictment necessary, no regret, no need for a duality. The self understands why it made the good choice. Upon reflection, it does not need to ask, "Which part of me deserves the glory?" The self can happily award itself—wholly and fully—for the propagation of its cause. This is important because, without the need to delineate body and mind, the self learns (with time) to function as one.

That is why we seek to reach nirvana. 

The duality of man, was painfully awoken in the Garden of Eden with a bite from the apple born from the tree of knowledge.

The knowledge of morality. The instrument to examine our consciousness - has woefully warped our ability to walk with God. 

If we had no concept of good and bad, we would exist and act as ONE. Yet, we have carved with dark lines what good and bad are - and have been bound by it, philosophically, culturally, economically, and individually. 

One is God.

Two is Man.

But, duality need not be 'objective' reality. While I, as a humble human, admit to using the tool - I do metaphysically believe that I am, and we are all, acting with oneness. We can only act with oneness. Good and bad are simply coloured filters we have been deeply encouraged to use for understanding. But they are human constructs, that only humans are burdened with. The universe (or God) does not need or use or understand duality - it just simply is, all together, at once. 

So, go forth, obliterate the blame, and focus on acting as one - being one with God and the universe. And see if you can get to 1.5.
